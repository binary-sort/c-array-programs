## Array Rotation

### Problem Statement
> To rotate an array for given number of rotations in both directions

There are two types of rotations:
* Left, in left_rotation.c
* Right, in right_rotation.c

### Solution
Simply shifting elements one at a time for given number of rotations.
Time complexity: __O(n^2)__
Space complexity: __O(1)__
