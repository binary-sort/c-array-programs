# Description of Problem with Solution

### Problem Statement
> To find the product of the maximum product subarray. Expected Time complexity is O(n) and only O(1) extra space can be used.
Hint: It is similar to Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray problem.

### Proposed Solutions

1)Algorithm
	*Description*:
  1)Intitialize minimum, maximum and result varible to the arr[0] element.
  2) Follow the loop and update minimum and maximum values according to the product of subarrays using max and min utility functions to compare the result.
  

	*Time Complexity*: __O(n)__
	*Space Complexity*: __O(1)__
